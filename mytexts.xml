The auditor asks the stake clerk for finances to have available the stake’s Unit Financial Statements, deposit records, and payment records for the six months being audited.

            <text>The “Other” category includes a subcategory called Authorized Member-Financed Activities. The funds for specific activities, such as Young Women camp, are called <i>unit subcategories</i>. You test the unit subcategories to make sure that (1) they are clearly identified for specific, appropriate, approved activities and that (2) the funds in the subcategories are spent only for the specified activity. There should not be any unspecified funds in the Authorized Member-Financed Activities subcategory. The grand total of unit subcategories should not be a negative amount.<br/><br/>For more information, see “The ‘Other’ Category” in the Help Center section of ChurchofJesusChrist.org. If your language is not available on that website, contact the stake audit committee for more information.<br/><br/>Use either the Income and Expense Summary screen (in LCR), the Income and Expense Summary by Subcategory Report (in MLS), or the Balance section on the Unit Financial Statement to complete the following worksheet.

			User Interface Changes
			</b><ul><li><b>Dashboard:</b> Dashboard icons now clearly indicate the audit status.
			</li></ul><br/><br/><b>
			Audit Form Changes
			</b><br/>
			In many areas, unit leaders and clerks have started using LCR to review and sign Unit Financial Statements online. The new online process allows for greater review flexibility, where needed, by allowing either a counselor or a clerk to participate in the statement review process. The audit question on Unit Financial Statement reviews has been modified to accommodate this flexibility.
			
			
			<br/><br/><br/><b>
			Question Automations
			</b><ul><li><b>Unit Financial Statement reviews:</b> Supplemental data now provides the auditor with each month’s online signature status. The auditing system will evaluate this data and provide a suggested answer with special instructions to assist the auditor.
			</li><li><b>Action items:</b> The system allows the auditor to view the unit’s most recent Unit Financial Statement. The statements may help the auditor determine whether the unit has outstanding action items older than 90 days.
			</li></ul><br/><br/><b>
			COVID-19
			</b><br/>
			COVID-19 audit impact: During the COVID-19 isolation period, some deposit and payment processes may have been temporarily modified to allow your stake to follow suggested isolation practices or local law. Please contact your stake audit committee to understand what modified processes, if any, were approved.
			
		
			<br/><br/>
			Deposits and payments created when isolation requirements were not in effect should have been processed in accordance with established Church policy and procedures. If deposits or payments occurred during the isolation period and your stake president or assigned area office approved modified processes, use these temporary modifications when answering audit questions.

            <text><b>Explanation:</b> During the audit, you will examine digital and physical evidence such as Tithing and Other Offerings forms, invoices, receipts, and reports to verify that Church-approved financial procedures are being followed. This examination is called “audit testing.”<br/><br/>Before you begin the audit, you may use <b>Select Transactions</b> in the navigation panel to preselect payments and deposits for audit testing. Reviewing transactions in advance saves time during the audit. More important, it gives you time to select transactions prayerfully and under the guidance of the Holy Ghost without feeling rushed.<br/><br/>Although <b>Select Transactions</b> is available throughout the audit, we recommend that you take time before the audit to select several payments and deposits for testing. When you save the selected transactions, the data is copied to the audit’s testing worksheets.<br/><br/><b>Instructions:</b> Each row is one transaction from the Church financial system. Click <b>Payments Selection</b> to view payment records. Click <b>Deposits Selection</b> to view deposit records. To mark a transaction for testing, check the Select box on that row. You may select more than one row before saving. Click a column heading to sort the rows by that column’s content. For example, click the Category heading to sort all of the payments by category (budget, fast-offerings, and so forth).</text>
        </record>
        <record id="page_label_lang:select.transactions.instructions">
            <text><b>Instructions:</b> Each row is one transaction from the Church financial system. Click <b>Payments Selection</b> to view payment records. Select a minimum of 18 payments for a ward unit and 12 payments for a stake unit. If the unit does not have the minimum number of payments, the system will select all the payments available. Click <b>Deposits Selection</b> to view deposit records. Select a minimum of 6 deposits for testing. If the unit does not have the minimum number of deposits, the system will select all the deposits available. To mark a transaction for testing, check the <b>Select</b> box on that row. You may select more than one row before saving. Click a column heading to sort the rows by that column’s content. For example, click the <b>Category</b> heading to sort all the payments by category (budget, fast-offerings, and so forth).<br/><br/>Some payments display an audit value of high or medium based on risk factors such as payment amount, category, and whether the payment has any Transaction Notes. Payments with a high or medium audit value which are determined to be the highest risk will have a blue star, indicating they are recommended for selection.<br/><br/>The auditor uses their discretion when considering which payments are selected for testing. Selections may include a combination of payments recommended for selection with a blue star, payments with a high or medium audit value, and the remaining payments made during the audit period.</text>

            <text>What to Look For. Every expenditure, including any advance, should have original receipts, invoices, or similar notices of amounts due or already paid. A check request alone is not adequate. If an original receipt or invoice is lost, substitute documentation should include a written explanation of the payment purpose, a description of the goods or services acquired, the payment period, and corroborating signatures (such as signatures of payees and beneficiaries). If a tested transaction lacks adequate support, mark "False."
When Support Is Missing. For an expenditure lacking adequate supporting documentation, consider alternate testing (such as interviewing payees or beneficiaries) after consultation with the audit committee chairman.
Scope of Testing. Test only those expenditures approved and disbursed at the center. If a center uses a stake or ward checking account for expenditures, these expenditures will be tested in the stake or ward financial audit and need not be tested here.</text>

            <text>For advances, verify that any unspent funds have been returned. You can determine unspent funds by comparing the total of the advance with the total corresponding receipts. If the center has its own Church Unit Checking Account, verify that the unspent funds were redeposited.
When possible, advances should be avoided because they increase risk and require additional follow-up. If any advance or portion of an advance has been used for personal or other unauthorized purposes, notify the audit committee chairman. Either you or the audit committee chairman should call the Church Auditing Department for further instructions as soon as possible before the audit is completed.</text>
